# SCA Frontend Take Home Test

Thanks for taking the SCA Frontend Coding Challenge! Please read the following instructions carefully.

This challenge **should take no longer than a coupe of hours** to complete & is here to assess your ability to write Javascript, HTML and CSS in a real world scenario.
 
## The Challenge
The task is to complete the 'Category' Page according to the design mocks.

## Getting Started
The project has been completely setup for you, including the routes, and API calls. The code you need to write yourself is minimal, and marked clearly with // TODO comments.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

Youâ€™ll need Node.js version `10.13` or later.

- Navigate to the `front-end-take-home` directory in your terminal
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the development server `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser, and you should see the home page.

You can also open storybook `npm run storybook` to check out some of the components already built.

## Requirements

Complete the `Category` Page (To get to it, click on one of the categories card on the Home Page).

- The layout should be responsive and match the mocks (4 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile).
- The page should visually match the mocks as closely as possible.
- The show name of the Card should be truncated to a single line.
- The description of the Card should be truncated to 3 lines.
- The page only needs to work on the *latest Chrome version*.
- Commit early and often, so that we can see how problems are solved.

####Bonus round!
- Add alphabetical sorting to the listings according to `design-mocks/mock-sort.png`. (Only if you still have time)

## Tips
- Review the mocks in `design-mocks` directory. There is a mock design for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
- The logical order to complete the tasks are:
  - Build the Show Card component
  - Render those cards on the Category.
  - Make it responsive
  - Add alphabetical sorting. (If you still have some spare time)
- You do not need to build everything from the scratch. You can reuse the components already built in this app if you want.

## How to submit

- Push the results to some remote source control (like Git)
- Email the bundle file to your point of contact.

Good luck,

The SCA Digital Team
